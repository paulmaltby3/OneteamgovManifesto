# Prototype One Team Government Manifesto
[(Skip straight to an uncluttered version of the manifesto)](https://paulmaltby3.github.io/OneteamgovManifesto/manifesto)

This document was designed as a prototype collaborative manifesto for what working seamlessly across digital and policy in government could look like. It is intended as a start of a conversation, and suggestions and updates are welcome. Obviously, it isn't any type of formal government document.

It is from the last in a series of blog posts I wrote in the run up to the [One Team Government](http://www.oneteamgov.uk/) unconference on 29 June 2017. They included a [crowdsourced reading list on digital for policy professionals](https://github.com/paulmaltby3/digitalpolicyreadinglist) interested in digging deeper on digital, a [short guide to policy for digital practitioners](https://medium.com/@maltbyps/one-team-government-a-short-guide-to-policy-for-government-digital-professionals-c3cc1e421406), and a reflection on [what the policy and digital communities could learn from each other](https://medium.com/@maltbyps/one-team-government-what-digital-and-policy-can-learn-from-each-other-c284b31b75ac).

The final post was an attempt to suggest how these two government communities could come together:

*"If we were to offer a blueprint for what doing or being ‘digital policy’ in government is, aiming for a government of (and not just on) the internet, what might it look like? What would be its outlook, its practices and scope? This is a first attempt at a digital policy One Team Government manifesto, offered to help prompt a longer and more collaborative discussion. It is written from the perspective of what being a digital policy maker could look like rather than something that aims to accurately describe the full range of roles across both the digital and policy professions, or of a newly merged single role (though it may be that such a broad perspective is possible)"*

The summary version is shown below, but it makes more sense with the short descriptions in the full document. In the fuller version each statement tries to set out a position that is contrasted with an alternative and plausible way of behaving in government; I was trying to avoid bland generic statements that everyone could easily sign up to regardless of their views or practices. I always liked the 'this, not that' approach in the Agile Manifesto and their disclaimer ['That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more'.](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

For policy people or others unfamiliar with amending written docs in GitHub, which included me last week, the [basic intro pages](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) are pretty self-explainatory (it turns out...) - you have to create a new branch before making changes, and then make a pull request to get them merged back into the main document.
